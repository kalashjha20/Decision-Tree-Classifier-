### I have built a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.
## Tools And Libraries Used:
### -> jupyter notebook
### -> pandas
### -> sklearn
### -> matplotlib.pyplot
## DATA ANALYSIS:
### During the data analysis, I have used pandas for cleaning the dataset and to find the missing values in the dataset.  I explored the data to identify key demographic and behavioral indicators relevant for predicting customer purchases. Then I find the accuracy score and classification score for finding the decision tree classifier using sklearn.  Then I have plot decision tree classifier using using sklearn and matplotlib. 
### Learnings : 
  #### This task helped me understanding categorical variable and also help in understanding machine learning concept
## Conclusion:
#### During the data analysis I got valuable insights into the variables of the dataset. It also help me in gaining the knowlwdge of machine learning and how data can be used to train the models. It will help my enhance my data science skill.
